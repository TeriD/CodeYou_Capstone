Analysis and Visualization of Traffic Accidents in Construction Work Zones in Kentucky

##Abstract
In 2023, there were over 1200 crashes in Kentucky roadway work zones, leading to 17 fatalities. This project aims to study traffic accident patterns within construction work zones across Kentucky. The project will use advanced data analysis and visualization techniques to integrate various datasets, identify key trends, and propose safety improvements. By combining KSP crash data with a comprehensive API of available roadway characteristics, the project aims to provide actionable insights to enhance roadway safety during construction activities. Tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, SQLite, Tableau, and Jupyter Notebook will ensure comprehensive and reproducible analysis.

##Problen Statement
Construction work zones are crucial areas where traffic accidents often occur due to changes in road conditions and traffic patterns. In 2023, Kentucky experienced a spike of over 1200 crashes in these zones, resulting in 17 fatalities. These accidents lead to significant economic losses and pose serious safety risks to workers and motorists. The project aims to understand and address the factors contributing to traffic accidents in these zones by analyzing historical crash data and correlating it with roadway characteristics. The goal is to identify patterns and propose safety improvements that can reduce the incidence and severity of these accidents.

##Goals and Objectives
Goal 1: Conducting a thorough analysis of traffic accidents in construction work zones:
    1. Collect and clean traffic accident data from the Kentucky State Police (KSP) dataset.
    2. Integrate available Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) roadway characteristics data by making API calls for each crash location.
    3. Analyze the merged dataset to identify trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to accidents in construction work zones.
Goal 2: Develop Comprehensive and Interactive Visualizations
    1.	Create visualizations using Matplotlib, Plotly, and Tableau to illustrate findings.
    2.	Develop a Tableau dashboard to present interactive and insightful visualizations for stakeholders.
